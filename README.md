# Hi there! I am Pablo, Astrophysicist and Data Scientist

I am an M.Sc Astrophysics and currently Data Science Master student. I mainly work with Machine Learning in Python in a wide variety of use cases and domain applications. 

Currently, I am finishing my  Masters Degree in Data Science at Herfordshire University, where I am about to begin with the final thesis work. I am particularly interested in deep learning methods and statistics, as well as in in image processing, mainly geared towards film scanning with digital cameras and the debayering process.
