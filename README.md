# Hi there! I am Pablo, Astrophysicist and Data Scientist

I am an M.Sc Astrophysics and currently a Python Engineer Intern and a Data Science Master student. I mainly work with Machine Learning in Python in a wide variety of use cases and domain applications. 

I am particularly interested in deep learning methods and statistics, as well as in in image processing, mainly geared towards film scanning with digital cameras and the debayering process.
