# Hi there! I am Pablo, Astrophysicist and Data Scientist

I am an M.Sc in Astrophysics and currently enrolled in a Computer Science: Data Science Master's program at Hertfordshire University. I mainly work with Machine Learning in Python in a wide variety of use cases and domain applications. 

Currently, I am working towards a publication to generalize the results from my research at LU to create an accessible and user-friendly tool for the astronomical community, by bridging the gap between the synthetic and observed spectroscopic domains using novel approaches based on artificial neural networks. While there are very interesting approaches to do so for single stars, those don't work, a priori, for binary stars.
