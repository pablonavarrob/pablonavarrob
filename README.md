# Hi there! I am Pablo, Astrophysicist and Data Scientist

I am an M.Sc Astrophysics and Data Science Master. I mainly work with Machine Learning in Python in a wide variety of use cases and domain applications. 

Currently, I am working towards a publication to generalize the results from my research at Lund University to create an accessible and user-friendly tool for the astronomical community, by bridging the gap between the synthetic and observed spectroscopic domains using novel approaches based on artificial neural networks. While there are very interesting approaches to do so for single stars, those don't work, a priori, for binary stars.

I am also very interested in image processing, mainly geared towards film scanning with digital cameras and the debayering process.
